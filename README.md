MailChecker2
============

This Electric Imp-powered device detects motion and reports it to you over the web.  It was originally designed to be stuck to a mailbox door to notify you over WiFi when mail is delivered.  It could also be used to monitor doors (including garage or pet doors), valuables that you don't want moved or cookie jars you want to keep children out of.

The board features an accelerometer, light sensor and Lithium-ion/polymer battery recharging built in.  It achieves approximately one month of use between charges per 100mAh of battery capacity, assuming two motion activations per day.

This is a totally valid design but I intend to publish a newer version with Li-ion battery protection for unregulated cells.  The battery attach terminals on the bottom are designed for a [138mAh Li-ion cell from HobbyKing](http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__37575__ZIPPY_138mAh_20C_Single_Cell_USA_Warehouse_.html), which is an unregulated cell (and therefore can be fatally over-discharged by this design.)
